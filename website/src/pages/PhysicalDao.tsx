          The Convergence Layer is where the ecosystem gathers in live settings. It organises and governs all physical, online or hybrid events — exhibitions, workshops, symposiums, and more — managing everything from venue access and expenses to the sale of cultural artefacts and the rewarding of participants who show up.
